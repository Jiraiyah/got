                    <p>Ok. Time to talk about spending. Now, before anything else, let me make one thing very clear for you. I’m not a spender, I only spent money for one online game ever and after some time, I regret it. I will talk about it more maybe later. But, if you want to spend money, you should know what you are doing and why you are doing it.</p>

<p>If you are one of those guys that are new to a special game and you see fancy stuff that are available only for those who spend money, I advise you against spending your money at the time. First, play the game, learn it’s core mechanics. Play at least one server from starting day to the end stage without spending a single dollar. Give yourself time to learn about everything in game. What is the usage of this tech, what is that building doing and what would it be like when you are at the end stage. Doing so, the next server you start playing, you would have good grasp on how everything works and if you see something available only for spenders, you would very well know if it’s usefull for long time usage, or is it just good early days and won’t be much usefull when you progress. At the same time, you would have good grasp about estimated money you would need to do something in game like upgrading a hero that would need spending for each and every upgrade.</p>

<p>If you are familiar enough with the game, and you want to spend, ask yourself a simple question: Why do you want to spend the money? If it’s for getting some very powerful armor that you may not survive in the server without it and you are really good at game, maybe, you need to leave this game right and now! Why? This is the very first sign of a game getting out of balance and sooner or later that game will go down the hill and each month you may see things getting worse. Stop playing it, look for another game that is more balanced. There is always a good game to play.</p>

<p>If you know that by getting that armor and any item, you would be better but without it you can survive with more time for playing the game, THAT is when you need to answer the second question: Do I have the time for that? If the answer is yes, again, don’t put the money in game. But if the answer is no, then the last question comes out: Does the money worth the saved time? For example, let’s say you can get an armor piece if you attack a special NPC in game for collect 100 of some materials for it. Each attack time will have a cool down of 5 minute and every five attacks you have a chance for collecting one piece and you need 5 piece of armor in total. How long should you play this?</p>

<p>100 materials needed * 5 attacks for each material means 500 attacks. Each attack will take at least 5 minutes so it means for one armor piece, you have to play for 2500 minutes. and you need 5 armors, so in total it will be 12500 minutes or 208 hour or 8 and a half day of non stop, without eating or sleep playing the game! Now you are not a robot. You are human, you need sleep, you need to eat, and most importantly, you have life, family to attend to, job to work and many other things. so most likely, you would play 2 hours a day for it? That would make it 100 days! Ok, Now, if the armor is available somehow for buying with real money, and lets say this is the ultimate, end of all, armor in the game, how much would it worth? Maybe 100 dollars? maybe 10 dollars? I don’t know! It totally depends on you!</p>

<p>Let’s keep that example in mind. Now how could a smart boy or girl play it? We all know that there are softwares out there that capture your mouse and keyboard and replay it over and over. If a smart boy would put 3 hours and capture a single attack cycle by this software….. He can let the software play the game over nights when he is asleep. each night the software would play that npc for minimum of 6 hours! So? this smart boy would get all the armor within 34 days without even being bothered with getting tired for it! Now how much that armor would worth in real money? 10 dollar? 1 dollar? Nothing at all? Again, it’s up to you. But one thing is for sure, it wouldn’t worth 100 dollar any more! How about a hard core player? He would play 4-6 hours per day himself, and would let the software play for the night for item collection. During that 6 hours of game play he would hit the npc and when the timer is cooling down, he would do other stuff. This guy, would reduce the needed time to half of the smart boy we talked about!</p>

<p>I think now you see what do I mean. If you can’t be a hardcore player, and won’t be able to keep your pc up and running every night, well, maybe you would want to spend the money for that armor set why? It’s the last and ultimate armor remember? There won’t be any better armor in game. And you would play the game for months. So you would go for spending. But if you are hardcore or the guy that would his pc do the job, you may stop yourself from spending few two digit dollars for that set!</p>

<p>Another time you may want to think about spending, is when there is the first days of server. The type of spenders that I agree and say they should do it, are those who know how to play the game, but they want to pass that early opening stage faster and get closer to middle transitional stage of the game (more about stages in future posts). These people know what they are doing and how they should use the money they put in the game, what they should get in the game and how to use each and every single of item. Yes, that would be allowed, why not. After all, we play the game to have fun.</p>

<p>The last time, is when you see something in game that is only avaialable for spenders. Now, as I said, comes a question. Is there anything in game available for free that would balance against this one? If yes, there is no point in spending the money. If no, Be careful, how much imbalance the game became? If the imbalance is growing, not only you should not pay, but maybe you should start looking for another game to replace this one. Why? This game is starting to die! But, if the imbalance is not a lot, you need to sit back and think, why would you like to have this item? Maybe it’s giving you a booster on upgrading the buildings and it’s useful at least for a month or two? Then what is the price? only five dollars? Well, you may want to buy it. But if it’s an item that would be useful for a week? No. If it would be useful for the whole gaming time but it’s 100 dollar? Then it boils down to how rich you are! There is a very simple money management rule you should always keep in mind for everything in life: only spend 10 percent of your unneeded money for having fun. No matter what the fun is, if you have 10 thousand dollars that you don’t need, you can spend 10 percent of it. If you have 100 dollar unneeded, again, 10 pecent of it. Any thing above this 10 percent, you spend that and it would mean you don’t know anything about money management in real life and sooner or later it will bite you back and teach you the hard way. Keeping this simple rule in mind, I think it would be really easy to identify the amount of money you can spend.</p>

<p>Also, One last thing, when you know how to play the game, you should put a point for yourself that beyound it, you will stop spending even one cent for the game. There should a point of no return that when you passed it, you should not spend ANY money. This point will be identified by two different things, one, how much money you have for spending, and two, what is the game mechanic and from what point forward, spending is not really needed. After that point, no matter how shiny an item in game looks like, no matter how powerful it looks like, you should stop. Why? If you don’t put a stop point for yourself, a day will come that you would sit and calculate and see that you spent hundreds of hard earned dollars for a game just to have fun when you could had the same fun without spending lots of that amount.</p>
