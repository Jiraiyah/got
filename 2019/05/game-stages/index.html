                    <p>ROS games, by nature, was meant to being played as time passes. Most of the time, no matter what is the name of the game, the game servers for these games stay for months even years and players will play the same server all that time. Sometimes, some developers decide to merge older servers together and make bigger servers and open room for another new server, and the cycle continues. In these sort of games, every now and then you would see new blood coming into the server but they are not new players, they played another server for months and just merged to this older server.</p>

<p>The main problem with many many players, is that they don’t understand the concept of realtime game playing. They got used to stand alone strategy games on their pc. Most of the time when they have played, they would finish a level on the game within hours. In contrast, realtime games will take really long time. In stand alone pc games, even the strategy games, you won’t have any stagging. You would play each level forward until the whole game ends.</p>

<p>On the other hand, ROS games are type of games that you may start playing and never end! That is the interesting part of these games. Around 10 years ago, there was a game called caesary. I played that game for four years without hopping to any new server. When I was leaving the server, it was already 5 years old. You heard it right. The server I started playing on, merged level by level to other servers and ended up in a giant massive server that had hundreds of very active, big players. In that server, you wouldn’t have a single hour without contineuous battle between all leagues. There was no allied league. Every league was enemy of others, they would all play, smile and enjoy continueing the play for years.</p>

<p>So, What are the stages we are talking about? Each ROS game, regardless of the game’s name and it’s looks, always has three stages: Early stage, Middle stage, and End stage. Identifying these stages is crucial. If you want to play these games for long time and being able to survive for years, from the very first day till you get to end stage of the game, you should know what stage you are in, what needs to be done, and what you should avoid doing it.</p>

<p>I know that it goes against some people’s taste. They are here to battle and not build up stuff. Be it as it is, let them play how they like it. But I’m telling you, I never ever saw this type of players staying for long time. They are here for early battle, and they may never understand or learn what happened, but not too late, a day will come that they are the small fry and other players who they laughed to at the start, will smash them daily based! So, let’s talk about these stages. Again, it’s up to you to play the game the way you like it. I’m only writing my years of experience here.</p>

<p>Early Stage: How to identify this stage? From the very first minute you join a server, you are in the early stage. As long as you have a building that needs to be updated, a hero that you need to update, a necessary tech in the tree that needs to upgraded, you are still in early stage. You may notice something here, there is no real time line for this. Only your advancing speed determines when a stage ends and another starts.</p>

<p>End Stage: This is when you have absolutely nothing more to do in the game as upgrading or things like that. You have all your heros, all on top level and fully armored, all tech in the tree, and the only thing you can do, is creating more and more troops and battle.</p>

<p>Middle Stage, or as I call it, Transitional Stage: Now, this stage may be there or you may never have this one. When I told you what will happen in this stage, you will understand why you may never have this stage. This stage sits between early stage and end stage. What you will do in this stage, is most of the time, reshaping your stuff in game, for example, in caesary, early game, ponies (horses) are absolutely the boss. But they eat lots of food and if you get to zero food, your troops will runaway from the city. So, end stage of game, it was always swordmen and bowmen (what ever the name it be in different games). Why? We will come to that later in another post when we will talk about core mechanics of ROS games. Long story short, when you finish early stage in caesary, you would know that the days for ponies where over and now you need more sword and bow men. But hey, to get up fast, you had at least one city full of stables, now what? That is when you would destroy some buildings (stables) and you would establish barracks. In other words, you had to reshape your city and get it ready for end stage. The problem was, you had stables at level 30, you need to destroy them level by level and building by building, and again rise barracks at level one and update them up to level 30. This would take a month or two by itself, that is if you didn’t have enough boosters. Even with enough boosters, it would take a week or two. When you would finish this process, that would be the end of middle stage and you were in the end stage.</p>

<p>Why did say you may not have middle stage? If you have played a game long enough, then from the very first day you start on a new account or server, you exactly know what will come at the end stage and what you would need then. I had seen many caesary players who would drop stables from the start and go all by barracks. These players would have progressed a little bit slower at start but as days would pass, they would be the tanks in the server and no one else would be able to survive a battle against them. The reason? When others were in middle stage, struggling to have more sword and bow, these guys where already at the end stage killing others left and right and slowing them down even more!</p>

<p>Now, each game may look different. Some games drop part of the core mechanic (more on that in another post) and some games may tweak the mechanics a little here and there. Depending on the mechnaics, if you sit back and think for few minutes from the start, knowing the base concept and the real core mechanics behind these games, you would be able to see the future of the game to some extend. Then, you can estimate what would be the end stage look like and you will make decisions based on everything you know and everything you guessed about the game. But without knowing the stages, you are doomed. Why is it? Each stage of the game is different than the other stage. Remember, you are playing a game that strategy has a very big role in it. You need to know what is the best strategy in each stage of the game and how should you progress in it.</p>

<p>Well, the end stage is obvious, you have nothing more to do but set the troop creation stack, and then go to battle. But early game stage, in my opinion, is the real main factor that decides who would be the big boy in long run and who is not. The reason is that, in early game stage, each step you take, each decision you make, can either help, or destroy, or at least slow you down in long run. I never understand those who want big battles, server domination, rulling a server or any type of these words, within the first month of the game! Seriously, you are here to play this game for years. If you ask me, as long as you are in early stage, you need to be causious about your actions against others. Remember, there will always be big boys who spend good amount of money and the least they can do, is going on your nerve and slow you down by constantly bothering you.</p>
