                    <p>Before I start talking about this business plan and it’s core mechanics, let me say something very clearly: If there won’t be players who spend money on the game, we won’t have these fancy and nice games to play! I have nothing against spending money for a game. But, knowing how this business plan works and it’s mechanics in the game development industry, will help you understand many things when you play these games.</p>

<p>Now, what is money leaching business plan?</p>

<p>In game industry, developers choose one of few different business plans:</p>

<p>1- Make the game, sell the whole game as a cd or dvd and get done with it. This business plan is old, makes money for developers but for a limited amount of time. As time passes, a newer game comes out and gamers will stop buying the old game. So, developers need to constantly create new games, make sure they advertise it good enough and as soon as one game came out and started selling, they need to think about the next game. There are few exeptions in this category like Skyrim who sold a lot and still some people continue buying it. But even the income for Skyrim slowed down after few months and the income these days are nothing compared to the first few months.</p>

<p>2- Develop the game, sell it, then, when the selling slowed down, publish addons for the game. Even Skyrim used this business plan. After all, it can be a very successful plan but it’s dependent on one single factor. The original game should be good and absorb many gamers so that when you start selling the DLC, those gamers would like to purchase it.</p>

<p>3- Money Leaching. In this business plan, the developers give the game for free. The whole point in this plan is to show something shiny and fancy to gamers that will only be available by spending real money and get tokens to get the item in game. It can be a sword, an armor, an ability or what ever else, the point is that, it will only be available to those who spend money. The success of this plan is dependent to two things. First is really simple, you should have items to show to players that they would like and want it badly. The second thing is a little hard, you need to convince them to buy it. This second part is what makes money leaching plan either very very successful, or it will fail very badly.</p>

<p>During last 10-15 years, many games tried this business plan. The first one that I remember and know about, was WOW. It was successful simply because it was first! No gamer really new what was happening under the hood, they would just see a very fancy looking 3D model as a sword with very juicy text about it’s stats and they would buy, buy, buy.</p>

<p>but as time passed, having success in this plan became harder and harder. Gamers became more alert about it and the number of spenders dropped. Developer chose another road that almost always doomed the game: make the game really out of balance, give so many items as purchasable only and leave those who won’t spend out of scope. I played many games. Some of them started as decent balance between those who spend and those who wouldn’t and that was a successful plan. But as time passed, developers of those games became greedy. Why shouldn’t they? After all, what they where seeing was that each month, more than hundreds of people would spend ten to hundred dollar just to play their game. So? Let’s focuse on them and drop those who won’t spend! And that was doom’s time for those games. As time would pass, those games would start getting out of balance more and more and more, to the point that if you wouldn’t spend money, there was no way in hell you could even survive in those servers playing the game as one of the smallest players no matter how much time and effor you would put into the game. Long story short, what came after this stage was that each one of those games started seeing less and less money income for developers!</p>

<p>Now this is the interesting part in this business plan. You would think, if you focus on those spending gamers, give them more stuff, you would earn more money! But no. It’s not working like that.</p>

<p>There are few different reasons people spend money for online games :</p>

<p>1- They want easier starting days, faster progression to middle stage of the game (I will talk about game stages in another post). These type of people, will spend as much as they think is ok, in first days of playing the game but after that, they know how to play, so, they won’t pay that much any more.</p>

<p>2- They don’t know how to play. They use real money as compensation for their lack of knowledge or slow progress. Using the items to boost their progress, replace the lost army, or things like this. Now, This group, is the main revenue of income for the developers. Why? Those who know how to play the game and are hard core gamers, will advance fast. They will smash this guy to pieces. This guy would want revenge. But wait. He has no more troops, he has no more resources, he is falling back a lot. How would he be able to get his revenge? Let’s spend a little bit more money and get back on our feet. After that? Time for revenge but, they get smashed again and this cycle will continue.</p>

<p>3- They don’t have patience at all. These time of players are in the middle of the other two ones. These people don’t understand the concept of real time strategy games. Building upgrades, meant to take days. But they don’t have the patience for that. Tech upgrade meant to take days, but they can’t wait. Troop creation won’t be fast and flashy, but they want it now! So? they start spending. They won’t stop spending simply because each time they hit the troop generation button and see the timer, they will look for speedups and they won’t have enough.</p>

<p>That is the business plan in nute shell. To have a successful game like this, you need a well balanced game to push spenders by none spenders! You need flashy, fancy looking, juicy text and stat items in game for spenders but at the same time, you should balance it out so that if people won’t spend but they are hard core players, they can keep the balance. And most importantly, you should never drop those none spender gamers from scope.</p>

<p>In the next post, I will start talking about spending itself. Would you want to coin for any game or not? And if you want to do it, what is the proper way of doing it and why.</p>
