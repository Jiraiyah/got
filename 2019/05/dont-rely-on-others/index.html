                    <p>Now, this topic is a bit tricky to write. In most of ROS games, you will have group of gamers who gather together. Some games call it guild, some alliance and some, league. The name is not important. The base concept for this mechanic, is to be able to help eachother, protect eachother and fight side by side eachother. But, that is the theory. What is the reality?</p>

<p>In many years I played ROS games, I had seen many alliances to fall apart, those who where friends yestarday, become new enemies of eachother and those who where fighting eachother become new friends. The bottom line is, in these type of games, a mechanic like an alliance, is very fluid and will change many many times as time passes. Also, there will always be a rank one alliance or guild or what ever the name is, in the server. Many people think joining these top first rank league is the best corse of action. Provided, a top rank alliance in some games, like GOT-WIC, can boost your first days of growth to some extend, but not as much as you fancy it! On the other hand, being in first rank alliance, means that you will always have enemies, even from day one. Many players would think that the big guys on that alliance will help protecting them. Guess what, it rarely happens! Why?</p>

<p>Think about it. There will always be people who spend good amount of money on the game and from day one, they are big guns in the server. Most likely, these players will have their own fight against eachother. Ofcourse, sometimes, one of these big players starts farming others (will write about farming in future days to come). If such thing happen, many newbies will call them bullies but that is not the case. On the other hand, when these big shots start battling eachother from early days, they will be busy with their own personal battles. It’s obvious isn’t it. They spent good amount of money just to by pass the early game stage within a day or two, and in the third day, they will be in middle stage of the game with big troops. Now what would they do? Hitting those players that barely started the game is pointless in every aspect. So? They find and battle eachother.</p>

<p>That is why, most of the time, after a week or two, you can never get help from these big shots, there is another reason for this. They are badly wounded! They had their great awesome fight in the very first week and now they lost tons of troops and need to reprovide them. Sadly, that won’t happen! Remember, I said they just bypass the early game stage and jump to middle game stage. They won’t be in end game stage by no means. What is the meaning of this? They won’t be able to reproduce that massive number of troops they had as fast as they thought it would happen! They need to attend to their own problems and one way or another, they won’t be able to help you.</p>

<p>Even if they can and they want to, they are humans. They won’t be online 24/7. My experience in ROS tells me that many of old school players start to notice the time line of most important people in the game just by looking around. For example, let’s say there is a big guy in the server that starts farming others. It will be really easy to know when he is online or possibly offline. Long story short, one of the enemies will notice when your big boy is asleep. That will be the time he will strike and you will stupidly think that the big boy will help. But unfortunately, at that moment, you are nothing more than a sitting duck!</p>

<p>There is also another aspect to this topic. When you join an alliance with some big boys in it, pay attention to what is going on in the alliance. If the leader is totally dependant to this big boy for all the glories you see on the alliance, then that alliance, sooner or later, will fall apart! Why? at some point, this big boy may decide to go single wolf. I had seen it so many times that I believe almost always the chance for such a thing to happen is above 80%! Ok, if the big boy goes single wolf or for what ever reason decides to join another alliance, what will happen then? The so glorious alliance, suddenly, in less than a minute, becomes a medium level within blinking of an eye!</p>

<p>I had seen so many servers, that in first days, an alliance started with not that much glory. But after a month or two? They were tanks that many of those big boys had trouble battling and survive against them. I will write more about how to choose a good alliance later in another post.</p>

<p>What I want to tell you in this post is this: Being in a powerful alliance is a double edge sword. Before anything else, you should think of how to survive as a single wolf in a wild server. You should never be dependant of others in the alliance and you should deep think about what is going on, why things are happening and how could it be better or even if it’s possible to be better or not.</p>

<p>Many people hesitate to leave an alliance. The concept is simple. They thing about what others in that alliance may say. If you ask me, they can say what ever they want! You are there, in that server, to play YOUR game! If for what ever reason, you feel that the alliance you are in, is not as good as it looked from out side, don’t even waste a single moment leaving it!</p>
