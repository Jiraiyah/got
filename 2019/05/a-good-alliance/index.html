                    <p>Let’s talk about alliances. When you are talking about ROS games, you are dealing with two different aspect of gaming. One aspect is war. There will always be war in these games. But the other aspect is strategy. When it comes to strategy, many many many people fail to be a good leader. What do I mean by that? A good leader is not someone who would send his members to early fight against many enemies at the same time. A good leader will always know how to do things and when to do things. A good leader should consider everything about every single one of memebers. At the same time, if needed to, he should be able to be harsh and push some gamers forward or even, away from themselves! On top of all of this, a good leader for these games should know many different aspects of being a strategiest.</p>

<p>If you ever entered an alliance and you saw a leader who conquered many big achivements in early game stage, sit back and think. How did he manage it? If he used proper strategy, then it’s fine. But if the whole glory belongs to a big boy or two or three of them in the alliance, then you should consider this leader as not so smart on strategy. Why?</p>

<p>Getting big achivements early in game, will turn many eyes toward your alliance. If every member in alliance had equal amount of part in that glory, then it’s fine. It means that every single one of them are big enough to survive the attention that would come towards them. Remember, in ROS servers, attention means battle and war! But if the whole thing was carried on by one or two big players, then that leader really DODN’T use strategy but simply he relied on tanks who no one else in server would be able to battle against. Then what? As soon as the attention turns toward that alliance, the big boys will their own fights. What about others? They will become MEAT in the middle of the battle!</p>

<p>That is why, a strategies leader, will know when to keep the whole alliance away from attentions and let their member grow. He would put time and effort in helping them grow not by giving them resources or recruit big boys, but by teaching them how to play the game and survive single manly. If a leader chooses big battle early game simply by causing too much attention to the alliance when at least over half of his members are not even big enough to defend themselves against half of the server, then that leader is not strategiest!</p>

<p>Having a good strategiest as leader, in ROS is crutial. I had seen many decent players getting fed up and leaving those top rank alliances just because the leader didn’t know what was the proper time to do something or not. Many active players who where new to the game, would fall apart and even leave the server or the game simply because their leader didn’t know when to do something and at any point and stage of the game, what needed to be done!</p>

<p>The last thing about a good alliance, is communication. Almost all of the ROS games have hierarchy of officer positions. After all, if you are playing a war game, like any military, you would need hierarchy of power and ranking. If you ever saw an alliance that their leader can’t communicate with their memebers properly, or, if you saw inactive officers, then that alliance is doomed. Remember, being an active officer does not mean a player who plays his own game. No. The officer player needs to tend to alliance’s needs with the rank, permissions and orders they have. If there is problem in officer ranks, specially if the leader won’t listen to complains and problems and behaves as a dictator, that is another very good reason to leave that alliance and never go back!</p>

<p>The last thing that shows you if you are in a good alliance or not, is how many actively communicating normal players you have. This is really important. People may sit and chit chat with eachother for hours. But when it comes to the game and alliance, if you read their chat, you would see there is absolutely zero importance in it. On the other hand, if you see an alliance that has players who won’t even say HI in the chat when they are around, that is a bad sign. It means that when the middle game stage comes, specially end stage, these players won’t be able to move in harmoney with others!</p>

<p>All in all, finding a good alliance early days of a server was never an easy task. But if you ask me, being alone, is much much much better than being in an alliance with a leader who has absolutely zero strategy or relies on the big boys or lacks the ability to communicate. If you are in an alliance that you have none of these problems but you have uncommunicating memebers, well, that alliance may survive specially if the leader decides to do a house cleanup and remove those players from alliace.</p>

<p>Few last words on this matter. As I said early in this post, many people think being in an alliance means they will have huge boost and help in the game. While a big alliance may produce some gain and benefit, it’s not as big of a booster as you think it is. On the other hand, being in an alliance that goes without proper short/middle/long time strategy, means that it will harm you more than helping you.</p>
