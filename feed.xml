				<title>Coin Or Not</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Ok. Time to talk about spending. Now, before anything else, let me make one thing very clear for you. I’m not a spender, I only spent money for one online game ever and after some time, I regret it. I will talk about it more maybe later. But, if you want to spend money, you should know what you are doing and why you are doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are one of those guys that are new to a special game and you see fancy stuff that are available only for those who spend money, I advise you against spending your money at the time. First, play the game, learn it’s core mechanics. Play at least one server from starting day to the end stage without spending a single dollar. Give yourself time to learn about everything in game. What is the usage of this tech, what is that building doing and what would it be like when you are at the end stage. Doing so, the next server you start playing, you would have good grasp on how everything works and if you see something available only for spenders, you would very well know if it’s usefull for long time usage, or is it just good early days and won’t be much usefull when you progress. At the same time, you would have good grasp about estimated money you would need to do something in game like upgrading a hero that would need spending for each and every upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar enough with the game, and you want to spend, ask yourself a simple question: Why do you want to spend the money? If it’s for getting some very powerful armor that you may not survive in the server without it and you are really good at game, maybe, you need to leave this game right and now! Why? This is the very first sign of a game getting out of balance and sooner or later that game will go down the hill and each month you may see things getting worse. Stop playing it, look for another game that is more balanced. There is always a good game to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know that by getting that armor and any item, you would be better but without it you can survive with more time for playing the game, THAT is when you need to answer the second question: Do I have the time for that? If the answer is yes, again, don’t put the money in game. But if the answer is no, then the last question comes out: Does the money worth the saved time? For example, let’s say you can get an armor piece if you attack a special NPC in game for collect 100 of some materials for it. Each attack time will have a cool down of 5 minute and every five attacks you have a chance for collecting one piece and you need 5 piece of armor in total. How long should you play this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100 materials needed * 5 attacks for each material means 500 attacks. Each attack will take at least 5 minutes so it means for one armor piece, you have to play for 2500 minutes. and you need 5 armors, so in total it will be 12500 minutes or 208 hour or 8 and a half day of non stop, without eating or sleep playing the game! Now you are not a robot. You are human, you need sleep, you need to eat, and most importantly, you have life, family to attend to, job to work and many other things. so most likely, you would play 2 hours a day for it? That would make it 100 days! Ok, Now, if the armor is available somehow for buying with real money, and lets say this is the ultimate, end of all, armor in the game, how much would it worth? Maybe 100 dollars? maybe 10 dollars? I don’t know! It totally depends on you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s keep that example in mind. Now how could a smart boy or girl play it? We all know that there are softwares out there that capture your mouse and keyboard and replay it over and over. If a smart boy would put 3 hours and capture a single attack cycle by this software….. He can let the software play the game over nights when he is asleep. each night the software would play that npc for minimum of 6 hours! So? this smart boy would get all the armor within 34 days without even being bothered with getting tired for it! Now how much that armor would worth in real money? 10 dollar? 1 dollar? Nothing at all? Again, it’s up to you. But one thing is for sure, it wouldn’t worth 100 dollar any more! How about a hard core player? He would play 4-6 hours per day himself, and would let the software play for the night for item collection. During that 6 hours of game play he would hit the npc and when the timer is cooling down, he would do other stuff. This guy, would reduce the needed time to half of the smart boy we talked about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think now you see what do I mean. If you can’t be a hardcore player, and won’t be able to keep your pc up and running every night, well, maybe you would want to spend the money for that armor set why? It’s the last and ultimate armor remember? There won’t be any better armor in game. And you would play the game for months. So you would go for spending. But if you are hardcore or the guy that would his pc do the job, you may stop yourself from spending few two digit dollars for that set!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another time you may want to think about spending, is when there is the first days of server. The type of spenders that I agree and say they should do it, are those who know how to play the game, but they want to pass that early opening stage faster and get closer to middle transitional stage of the game (more about stages in future posts). These people know what they are doing and how they should use the money they put in the game, what they should get in the game and how to use each and every single of item. Yes, that would be allowed, why not. After all, we play the game to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time, is when you see something in game that is only avaialable for spenders. Now, as I said, comes a question. Is there anything in game available for free that would balance against this one? If yes, there is no point in spending the money. If no, Be careful, how much imbalance the game became? If the imbalance is growing, not only you should not pay, but maybe you should start looking for another game to replace this one. Why? This game is starting to die! But, if the imbalance is not a lot, you need to sit back and think, why would you like to have this item? Maybe it’s giving you a booster on upgrading the buildings and it’s useful at least for a month or two? Then what is the price? only five dollars? Well, you may want to buy it. But if it’s an item that would be useful for a week? No. If it would be useful for the whole gaming time but it’s 100 dollar? Then it boils down to how rich you are! There is a very simple money management rule you should always keep in mind for everything in life: only spend 10 percent of your unneeded money for having fun. No matter what the fun is, if you have 10 thousand dollars that you don’t need, you can spend 10 percent of it. If you have 100 dollar unneeded, again, 10 pecent of it. Any thing above this 10 percent, you spend that and it would mean you don’t know anything about money management in real life and sooner or later it will bite you back and teach you the hard way. Keeping this simple rule in mind, I think it would be really easy to identify the amount of money you can spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, One last thing, when you know how to play the game, you should put a point for yourself that beyound it, you will stop spending even one cent for the game. There should a point of no return that when you passed it, you should not spend ANY money. This point will be identified by two different things, one, how much money you have for spending, and two, what is the game mechanic and from what point forward, spending is not really needed. After that point, no matter how shiny an item in game looks like, no matter how powerful it looks like, you should stop. Why? If you don’t put a stop point for yourself, a day will come that you would sit and calculate and see that you spent hundreds of hard earned dollars for a game just to have fun when you could had the same fun without spending lots of that amount.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Money Leaching Mechanic</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Before I start talking about this business plan and it’s core mechanics, let me say something very clearly: If there won’t be players who spend money on the game, we won’t have these fancy and nice games to play! I have nothing against spending money for a game. But, knowing how this business plan works and it’s mechanics in the game development industry, will help you understand many things when you play these games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what is money leaching business plan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In game industry, developers choose one of few different business plans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1- Make the game, sell the whole game as a cd or dvd and get done with it. This business plan is old, makes money for developers but for a limited amount of time. As time passes, a newer game comes out and gamers will stop buying the old game. So, developers need to constantly create new games, make sure they advertise it good enough and as soon as one game came out and started selling, they need to think about the next game. There are few exeptions in this category like Skyrim who sold a lot and still some people continue buying it. But even the income for Skyrim slowed down after few months and the income these days are nothing compared to the first few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2- Develop the game, sell it, then, when the selling slowed down, publish addons for the game. Even Skyrim used this business plan. After all, it can be a very successful plan but it’s dependent on one single factor. The original game should be good and absorb many gamers so that when you start selling the DLC, those gamers would like to purchase it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3- Money Leaching. In this business plan, the developers give the game for free. The whole point in this plan is to show something shiny and fancy to gamers that will only be available by spending real money and get tokens to get the item in game. It can be a sword, an armor, an ability or what ever else, the point is that, it will only be available to those who spend money. The success of this plan is dependent to two things. First is really simple, you should have items to show to players that they would like and want it badly. The second thing is a little hard, you need to convince them to buy it. This second part is what makes money leaching plan either very very successful, or it will fail very badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During last 10-15 years, many games tried this business plan. The first one that I remember and know about, was WOW. It was successful simply because it was first! No gamer really new what was happening under the hood, they would just see a very fancy looking 3D model as a sword with very juicy text about it’s stats and they would buy, buy, buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but as time passed, having success in this plan became harder and harder. Gamers became more alert about it and the number of spenders dropped. Developer chose another road that almost always doomed the game: make the game really out of balance, give so many items as purchasable only and leave those who won’t spend out of scope. I played many games. Some of them started as decent balance between those who spend and those who wouldn’t and that was a successful plan. But as time passed, developers of those games became greedy. Why shouldn’t they? After all, what they where seeing was that each month, more than hundreds of people would spend ten to hundred dollar just to play their game. So? Let’s focuse on them and drop those who won’t spend! And that was doom’s time for those games. As time would pass, those games would start getting out of balance more and more and more, to the point that if you wouldn’t spend money, there was no way in hell you could even survive in those servers playing the game as one of the smallest players no matter how much time and effor you would put into the game. Long story short, what came after this stage was that each one of those games started seeing less and less money income for developers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is the interesting part in this business plan. You would think, if you focus on those spending gamers, give them more stuff, you would earn more money! But no. It’s not working like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few different reasons people spend money for online games :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1- They want easier starting days, faster progression to middle stage of the game (I will talk about game stages in another post). These type of people, will spend as much as they think is ok, in first days of playing the game but after that, they know how to play, so, they won’t pay that much any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2- They don’t know how to play. They use real money as compensation for their lack of knowledge or slow progress. Using the items to boost their progress, replace the lost army, or things like this. Now, This group, is the main revenue of income for the developers. Why? Those who know how to play the game and are hard core gamers, will advance fast. They will smash this guy to pieces. This guy would want revenge. But wait. He has no more troops, he has no more resources, he is falling back a lot. How would he be able to get his revenge? Let’s spend a little bit more money and get back on our feet. After that? Time for revenge but, they get smashed again and this cycle will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3- They don’t have patience at all. These time of players are in the middle of the other two ones. These people don’t understand the concept of real time strategy games. Building upgrades, meant to take days. But they don’t have the patience for that. Tech upgrade meant to take days, but they can’t wait. Troop creation won’t be fast and flashy, but they want it now! So? they start spending. They won’t stop spending simply because each time they hit the troop generation button and see the timer, they will look for speedups and they won’t have enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the business plan in nute shell. To have a successful game like this, you need a well balanced game to push spenders by none spenders! You need flashy, fancy looking, juicy text and stat items in game for spenders but at the same time, you should balance it out so that if people won’t spend but they are hard core players, they can keep the balance. And most importantly, you should never drop those none spender gamers from scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post, I will start talking about spending itself. Would you want to coin for any game or not? And if you want to do it, what is the proper way of doing it and why.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Welcome to GOT-WIC</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://got.gtarcade.com&quot;&gt;Game Of Thrones, Winter Is Coming&lt;/a&gt; (GOT-WIT) game, is one of ROS type of games (Realtime Online Strategy). If you want to become a big, powerful player, before anything else, you need to understand much more about this type of game, it’s core mechanics and why and what about this core mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day internet connections could handle tranfering of big data faster, game industry started the concept of online gaming. Why? I will write about it in another post. The very first concept that the industry used, was multiplayer FPS (First Person Shooter) games. It was easy, it was fast to implement, and gamers loved it a lot. But a new game came out that changed everything in the industry, the name? World Of Warcraft (WOW for short).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did WOW do? It was a very simple concept to be honest. You see, up until then, gamers would PAY and buy the CD for game and that was it. The multiplayer - online concept was written in game and the mechanics for the online game play was P2P (peer to peer) and industry and game developers didn’t need to have a server or care about what would happen online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But WOW changed this! You really didn’t need to pay much to have the game, but… The game had many many servers, it was one of the first MMO games out there (massive multiplayer online). For keeping up MMO games, developers need to have servers, maintain those servers, make sure there won’t be any security breach and many more things and all those things, would eat money. So, developers added a very simple concept, a concept that would change the whole game development industry in years to come. Player would be able to BUY items inside the game with real money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First days, when WOW done this, I remember it very clearly. We would laugh and say, who would be stupid enough to spend money all the time just to play a game? But as time passed, day in day out, we would see people coming to caffee nets (some shops that had many computers for people to use and connect to net, good old days) and spend and spend and spend, just to have that hammer or this armor in WOW!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, WOW changed everything both for gamers and the industry. I will write more about it later but for time being, lets move on. So, GOT-WIT is an online game, meaning, it has servers, you join those servers and play. Also, it uses the same concept as WOW. Players CAN buy items inside the game with real money (We call the process coining and those who spend money on the game as coiners).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the game, is Strategy. Like any other strategy game out there, you will have buildings, tech tree, and army and armor. The more buildings are updated, the better they come. The more tech tree updated, the faster and more powerful some aspects of the game become. And the more everything goes forward, the more advance troops and more powerful army and armor you can have. Simple isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the last part, REALTIME. I don’t know why, but many people ignore this aspect. As we will write about the game, guides on game play and anything else, here and there, we will come back to this aspect. What is the meaning of realtime? In many strategy games that are available on PC for single player, updating a building won’t take more than few minutes or the most, an hour or two. But in realtime game, oh god, every old and new god, it can take DAYS. Yup, you heared it right, days! I lost the count of servers i played this type of game on them, but as always, I had seen many people who can’t grasp the concept for the game being realtime. The join a new server, and even in the very first week, they are looking for fight after fight after fight. They will never advance that much on building levels, nor the tech tree, why? Because it take ages! Well dude, you are playing a REALTIME game, ofcourse it would take ages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I had seen many of these people, they join a new server, play it for a week or two, and as soon as a new server opens afterward, they leave the previous server calling it boring and joining the new server and the loop continues. I know, they like fighting and killing in game, but, don’t we all like that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, these people never understand and feel the joy of end game stage. The call the game boring because the buildings will take lo~ng time to upgrade. But, if you play a single server for some time, eventually you will come to a stage that there is no building left for upgrade! There will come a day that there won’t be any open tech in the tree to upgrade. That is the END STAGE for the game. That is when the real FUN begins! You would go to battle each and every day! You will kill and get your army killed each and every day. You will loose tons of troops, and you would rebuild the number in few days and get your revenge. And this joy, never ends. You won’t need to be concerned about building or tech or armor update any more. Just add more troops on creation stack, and start fighting!&lt;/p&gt;
